## Visual evidence

<!-- Check one. Visible UI changes need evidence from a real rendered flow. -->

- [ ] Not applicable; this PR has no visible UI change.
- [ ] Before/after screenshots or other rendered-flow evidence are attached below.

Evidence:

## Governance and documentation

- [ ] I read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/CHECKLISTS.md` in full; for a
      substantive change I mapped `BIBLE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
      `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, and `docs/DESIGN.md` by their headings and read
      every section relevant to this change in full.
- [ ] I updated tests and documentation where behavior or architecture changed.
- [ ] I did not include secrets, local settings, runtime state, logs, caches, or
      generated build/review artifacts in the commit.
- [ ] I did **not** bump `VERSION` or release-only version carriers; maintainers
      assign the collision-free release version during final integration.

## Review evidence

<!--
Have a separate agent context review the final committed diff without editing
it. A subagent, new task, or fresh agent session counts; self-review in the
authoring conversation does not. Evidence must match the current base/head
range, so rerun after code changes or a rebase. If no separate agent is
available, use NOT_RUN and say why.
-->
