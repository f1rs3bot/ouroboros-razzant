    """POST /api/decisions body — the ONE answer ingress for owner decision
    cards (owner decision 1=A). ``decision_id`` is a composed family id:
    ``quiz:{task_id}:{quiz_id}``, ``routing:{client_message_id}:{routing_token}``,
    ``model_wait:{task_id}:{wait_id}``, or the reserved
    ``interaction:{task_id}:{run_id}:{interaction_id}`` family.
    ``request_id`` is the idempotency key; a replayed request returns the
    recorded confirmation instead of acting twice. ``comment`` is the owner's
    optional verbatim remark on quiz/routing decisions.

    ``option_index`` is optional for the quiz family: an owner who takes none
    of the offered options answers with a non-empty comment and no index.
    Routing requires the integer — its choice IS the option. Model waits
    instead require revision and action, with the matching action fields;
    persist_role defaults false, and an empty credential profile means Auto.
    Each ingress validates its own closed field set before effects.
