"""Live-first delivery of owner-directed chat events from a running task.

One seam for the send family (``send_user_message`` / ``send_photo`` /
``send_video`` / ``send_file`` / ``send_links``): try the live worker event
queue first so the owner sees the frame while the task is still RUNNING, and
fall back to ``ctx.pending_events`` (the end-of-task drain) when live
transport is unavailable. The transport contract mirrors
``_emit_control_event`` (tools/control.py) — live XOR deferred, never both —
with three structural gates:

- **Background consciousness stays deferred.** The consciousness loop wires a
  live queue into the shared ctx before every tool call and aggregates
  ``pending_events`` at cycle end (with pause deferral), so gating on queue
  presence alone would leak frames from uncommitted or paused cycles.
- **A2A chats stay deferred.** A peer's ``wait_for_response`` subscription
  resolves on the FIRST non-progress chat frame, so a live mid-task frame
  would hijack the answer the peer is waiting for.
- **Sticky-deferred after the first live failure.** Once one frame falls back
  to the buffer, later frames must not overtake it: narrative order beats
  freshness, so the task finishes the attempt on the deferred path.

Frames must stay multiprocessing-safe by construction (JSON primitives and
base64 strings only): the production worker queue is manager-backed, so a
poison value raises at the caller and falls back cleanly — but a plain
``multiprocessing.Queue`` transport would serialize in a feeder thread and
lose it AFTER ``put_nowait`` returned, so the by-construction rule is the
contract, not the transport's forgiveness.

Retry semantics are the progress channel's: a live-delivered frame from a
failed attempt is not recalled, and a retried task may narrate again. That is
an accepted property of live delivery, not a defect to dedupe away.

Known, pre-existing exception to the ordering rule: the blocking-post-task
final-answer shortcut (``deliver_final_message_live``) may ship the FINAL
ahead of frames still buffered here — the answer is deliberately never held
hostage to trailing narration. The sticky rule orders the send family among
itself, not against the terminal shortcut.

    Lineage (``task_id`` / ``parent_task_id`` / ``root_task_id``) is stamped
