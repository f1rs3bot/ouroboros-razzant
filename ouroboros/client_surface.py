"""Owner Surface Fact: per-message client-surface provenance helpers.

The SPA measures raw sending-surface observables at send time and attaches
them to the chat frame; this module owns the fact's normalization boundary,
its surface-identity projection, and the mailbox surface-change note. It is
a dedicated module (rather than message_bus/loop code) so those size-gated
modules stay inside their ratchet limits; the ``owner_client`` context
rendering lives in ``ouroboros/context.py`` and host channel stamps are
assembled at their producers.

``normalize_client_surface`` is the ingress boundary for the untrusted-ish
browser payload: a CLOSED key set with bounded values — unknown keys are
dropped, every string bound is DISCLOSED (strict wire bound, marker inside the
limit), and an empty/non-dict result is None so ``{}`` can never slip through
metadata filters as a phantom fact. Host-built channel facts
(``{"channel": <source>}``) do not pass through here; they are trusted host
stamps assembled at their producers.
