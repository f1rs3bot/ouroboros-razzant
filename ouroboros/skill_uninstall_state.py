"""Uninstall tombstones for per-skill owner state (CPL4-C11, owner batch 3A).

Uninstalling a skill removes its payload but its ``state/skills/<name>/``
directory used to outlive it forever (only ``deps.json`` was cleared). The
hub uninstall paths now write an ``uninstalled.json`` tombstone, and the
startup sweep clears the dead state BY that mark — keeping ``grants.json``
(granted keys are OWNER authority, preserved across reinstall) and the
tombstone itself. A reinstall self-heals: the sweep sees a live payload and
retires the tombstone instead of sweeping.

Explicit local deletion also lives here. Unlike marketplace uninstall, it
removes the entire state directory under the owner's specific delete action.
