"""Boot-resume of the assisted managed-update resolver after a terminal shutdown.

The live-observed wedge (v6.105.x E2E): SIGTERM during ``assisted_resolution``
writes a durable terminal (cancelled) result for the recorded resolver task; on
boot the resume re-enqueued the SAME id, which ``_drop_cancelled_pending``
silently dropped pre-assignment — the tx sat in ``assisted_resolution`` with no
resolver task and no orphan watchdog (it only arms on task_done). These tests
pin the fix: a terminal recorded resolver is re-enqueued under a FRESH task id,
the tx's recorded id follows it, and the paid-review-cycle money ceiling stays
keyed to the ORIGINAL resolver id across the whole resume chain.
