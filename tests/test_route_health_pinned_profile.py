"""route_health admission contract: the engine, not the default store, decides.

Two owner decisions shaped this surface. 2026-08-18 (reviewer-slot incident):
a pinned credential profile must reach the engine even when the harness row's
aggregate status reads "unavailable" — that status describes the DEFAULT
credential store only. 2026-08-28 (cx-delegation sprint, «статус обманывает,
игнорируй его и всё равно пробуй запустить» + 7=A): the same is true for
UNPINNED routes — a pool-only harness (agy, INV-135) read "unavailable"
FOREVER while its real accounts lived in the engine's credential-profile pool,
so the aggregate doctor STATUS stopped being a refusal entirely. The row's
`enabled` field is different: it is the owner's settings toggle and still
refuses unpinned routes as `route_disabled`.
Admission belongs to the engine: an empty or exhausted pool answers the start
POST with its own typed refusal (INV-135 ``credential_pool_exhausted``), which
under the pre-start charter costs zero model rounds. The engine's belt
capability row (``delegation.available``) is likewise not consulted: Ouroboros
runs never request the belt (no ``extra_mcp_servers``).

What still refuses, pinned or not: catalog absence, access-profile fit for the
shape, the delegated-marker version floor, and positively-known quota
exhaustion for the route's model.

Offline unit fixtures only: a duck-typed gateway answering the manifest
questions route_health asks. No daemon, no network.
