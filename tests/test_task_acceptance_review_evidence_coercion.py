"""Regression coverage for ibl-329e1741d5f9.

task_acceptance_review crashed with `dictionary update sequence element #0
has length 1; 2 is required` when `evidence` arrived as something other than
a dict — most plausibly a JSON-encoded string, which some providers emit for
object-typed tool arguments instead of a nested object. `dict(some_str)`
iterates the string char-by-char, and each single character is not a
length-2 (key, value) pair, hence that exact error text.
